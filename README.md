# Deploying machine learning model
Implementation of a housing cost prediction model using the service architecture in the Machine Learning Engineering course using technologies such as DVC for data version control, GCP for cloud storage, Cloud Run and Docker for launching and accessing the model endpoint, CML for continuous integration, Github workflow for automation of changes and finally Pytest to check the model accuracy and avoid potential errors.
